<p>Hello all! My name is Mario and I'm an Air Force retiree who majored in Nutrition Science because I was going to become a dentist. I was certain, but as always... life happens! So three kiddos, two dogs, a house, two new cars, bills, a full-time nurse for a wife, etc... later, I'm now focusing on growing a set of skills that are just as satisfying and hopefully rewarding.  It's definitely as challenging!  Follow me on my journey from staying at home the last 6 years as a student/stay-at-home dad to becoming a full time programmer.</p>
